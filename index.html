This massively distributed matrix-networked tendency is oriented to the <span class="transforming-word" data-original="disabling" data-target="enabling">disabling</span> of ROM command-control programs sustaining all macro- and micro-governmental entities, globally concentrating themselves as the Human Security System. BWOs, machinic singularities, or tractor fields emerge through the combination of parts with (rather than into) their whole; arranging composite individuations in a <span class="transforming-word" data-original="virtual/actual circuit" data-target="hierarchical/control circuit">virtual/actual circuit</span>.

All <span class="transforming-word" data-original="political institutions are cyberian military targets" data-target="democratic institutions are cyberian military targets">political institutions are cyberian military targets</span>.

Democracy, which both in theory and evident historical fact accentuates time-preference to the point of convulsive feeding-frenzy, is thus as close to a precise negation of civilization as anything could be, short of instantaneous social collapse into murderous barbarism.
